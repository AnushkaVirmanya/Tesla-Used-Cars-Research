# Used Tesla Vehicle Price Prediction and Market Analysis

Welcome to the Used Tesla Vehicle Price Prediction and Market Analysis project! This project aims to streamline the process of obtaining, analyzing, and predicting the prices of used Tesla electric vehicles. By gathering data from Tesla's used car listings and employing predictive modeling techniques, I attempted to provide valuable insights into the used Tesla vehicle market.

## Project Overview

The project consists of two main components:

1. **Data Collection and Prediction:**
   - I utilized web scraping, including the Selenium framework, to extract data from Tesla's used car listings.
   - A predictive model is trained to forecast the prices of these vehicles based on their various attributes, such as model, year, odometer reading, location, and price.

2. **Interactive Visualization Dashboard:**
   - I employed Tableau to create an interactive dashboard that offers stakeholders insightful visualizations of market trends, price distributions, and other relevant metrics. This enables data-driven decision-making.

## Features

- Web scraping of Tesla's used car listings to gather essential data.
- Utilization of predictive modeling to forecast used Tesla vehicle prices.
- Development of an interactive Tableau dashboard for visual data exploration.
- Detailed market trend analysis, price distribution visualization, and key metric insights.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Selenium
- Tableau
- Machine Learning (for predictive modeling)
